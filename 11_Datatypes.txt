immutable:
When you "modify" an immutable object, a new memory location is allocated for the new object. The old object, if no longer referenced, becomes eligible for garbage collection.

mutable:
When you modify a mutable object, no new memory is allocated for the object itself (unless the modification requires resizing, like appending to a list that exceeds its current capacity).
