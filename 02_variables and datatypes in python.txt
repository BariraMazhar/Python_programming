-----------
 Variable
-----------
	Variable are memory locations that are used to store data.These are the containers that hold data.In python, assigning a value to a variable is very easy.
For Example:
		a=1
		b="Python"
		c=10.5
			etc.

------------
 Data type
------------
	datatype specifies the value that a variable holds.These are used in performing operations on variables.
For Example:
		a=1   #integer data type
		b="Python"   #string data type
		c=10.5   #float datatype
		    etc.

	1-Numeric data: (int, float)
		int: a=1
		float: c=10.5

	2-Text data: str (string)
		b="python"

	3-Sequenced data: (List, Tuple)
		i-List:
			List is an ordered collection of data elements separated by comma and enclosed in square brackets that can be modified after creation.
For Example:
		list1= ["Lion","Tiger","leopard"]

		ii-Tuple:
			Tuple is an ordered collection of data elements separated by comma and enclosed in parenthesis that is immutable and can not be modified after creation.
For Example:
		tuple1= ("parrot","sparrow","crow")


	4-Mapped data: dict (dictionary)
		 dictionary is an unordered collection of data containing key:value pairs and enclosed within curly braces.
For Example:
		dict1={"name":tony, "age":48, "gender":"male"}
 

     * In Python,we can print the type of any variable using 'type' function.
	For Example:
			a=1
			print(type(a))
