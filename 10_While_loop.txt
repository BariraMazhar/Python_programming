-----------
Python While Loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. When the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.

	Syntax:
			while (condition):
			    statement(s)


	Example:
			count=0
			while(count<=10):
			    print(count)
			    count=count+1
