Introduction to Python Programming
--------------------------------------------------
Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly language known for its readability and ease of use. 
It's widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

Features of Python Programming
-------------------------------------------
         * Python is freely available, and its source code can be modified 
         * Python is dynamically typed.You don't need to specify variable types; Python infers them at runtime.
         * python is platform independent.
         * Python supports OOP(object oriented programming).
         * It can be easily integrated with other languages like C, C++, and Java.

How to write program in Python
--------------------------------------------
	* Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define blocks of code. Python does not use braces {} to denote blocks.
	For example:
		if condition:
		    statement1
    		    statement2
	* A colon' : ' is used to indicate the start of an indented block, such as in loops, conditionals, functions, and classes.
	* If a statement is too long to fit on one line, you can use a backslash \ to continue it on the next line.
	 For Example:
		sum= 1+2+/
		          3+4
	* No need of semicolon aat the end of every statement.
	* Strings can be defined using either single (') or double (") quotes.
 	For Example: 
		'Hello, World!', "Python is awesome"

	* Comments start with # and are used to add explanations or notes to your code. 
	For Example:
		# This is a comment.
	* It is not necessary to define datatype of a variable in python as it automatically decides the datatype according to the value given to a variable.
	For Example:
		x = 5      # x is an integer
		y = 3.14   # y is a float

Python Print statement
-------------------------------
The Python "print" statement is a built-in function used to display information on the screen. It allows programmers to output text, variables, or expressions to the console. .
 For example, 
	print("Hello, World!") 
will display the text "Hello, World!" on the console.
