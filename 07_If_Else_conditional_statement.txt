conditional statement
---------------------
Sometimes the programmer needs to check a condition before executing a statement,such type of statements are called conditional statements.



-----------------
IF-Else statement
-----------------
If else statement is used when one statement is executed when the condition is true and execute the other statement when the condition is false.
The syntax of IF-else statement is:
			if(condition):
			     statement 1
			else:
			     statementt 2


	Example: If your age is over 18,you can drive.Otherwise you can't.
			
				age=int(input("Enter your age: "))
				print("your age is ",age)
				if(age>18):
				    print("you can drive")
				else:
				    print("you can't drive")


-------------------
If-ElseIf statement
-------------------
when there are more than two choices available and only one can be executed based on condition, such type of statements are called If-ElseIf or Elif statement. 
The syntax of Elif statement is:
			if(condition):
			     statement 1
			elif(condition):
			     statementt 2
			else:
			     statement 2


	Example:
			num=int(input("Enter a number: "))
				if (num>0):
				    print("number is positive")
				elif (num<0):
				    print("number is negative")
				else:
				    print("The number is zero")


-------------------
Nested If statement
-------------------
If statement enclosed by another if statement is called nested if statement.The condition of outer if is checked first and then the condition of inner if checked.
The syntax of nested if is:
			if(condition):
			     if(condition2)
				   statement 1
				   statement 2
			     else:
				    statement 3
			else:
			     statement 4



	Example:
			num=int(input("Enter a number: "))
				if (num==0):
				        print("The number is zero")
				elif(num>0):
					if (num<=10):
					     print("number is between 1-10")
				else:
   				        print("number is negative")
